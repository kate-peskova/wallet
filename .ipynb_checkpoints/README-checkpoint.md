Creating Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python

## Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python
In this project, we will install a hierarchical deterministic wallet using the Python hd-wallet-derive tool. Although this wallet can be universal, we would only concentrate on two coins â€“ Bitcoin and Etherium on a test net. My operating system is MAC OS, thus, I will use the terminal and the corresponding Mac commands throughout this project.

To start out the project, we need to install the hd-wallet-derive tool in our project directory using the following set of commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive
  cd hd-wallet-derive
  curl https://getcomposer.org/installer -o installer.php
  php installer.php
  php composer.phar install
```

Once the hd-wallet tool is installed, we will create the _derive_ symlink running the following command:

```
ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive
```

To interact with the hd-wallet-tool, we will use Python. The links to the code files are listed below.

* [constants.py](python/constants.py)
* [wallet.py](python/wallet.py)

Activate the local network nodes. Please refer to this tutorial for details.

To interact with wallet.py through the terminal, start out with the following commands and replace them with the appropriate parameters:

```
>>> from wallet import *
>>> account=priv_key_to_account(COIN, 'PRIVATE KEY')
>>> transaction=send_tx(COIN, account, ADDRESS, amount)
```

We will use a block explorer to watch the BTC transactions on the address.

To confirm an ETH transaction, we will use MyCrypto app.
